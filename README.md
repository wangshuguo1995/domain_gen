### DOMAIN GEN

###### Search for random, available, 2-word domains. Availability and price are returned.

Set entries in <code>domain_gen/resources/config.yml</code> for:

<pre>
  <code>
tld: .com               -> top level domain   (.com  .org  .net  .io   etc...)
max_records: 1000       -> max number of records to print to stdout/write to file
write_to_file: False    -> records will be written to project root as JSON if set to True
  </code>
</pre>

The program will terminate when max_records is reached or <code>ctrl-c</code> is pressed.
